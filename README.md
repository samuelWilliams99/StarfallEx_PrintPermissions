# StarfallEx_PrintPermissions
Add print permissions to Garry's Mods StarfallEx

## Usage
Simply add this repo to your addons folder, with StarfallEx installed ( Version 3.1 or later ), and you're all set!  

This adds 4 permissions to clients, all defaulting to `Owner Only`:
- `print.chat` - Allows the starfall to print to your chat (and by extension, your console).
- `print.console` - Allows the starfall to print to your console.
- `print.screen` - Allows the starfall to print to the center of your screen.
- `print.color` - Allows the starfall to print in color where it is allowed, otherwise, prints are blue.
